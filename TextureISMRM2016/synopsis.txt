We have investigated how image resolution, image noise, the choice of b-values, GLCM size and the method for determining the dynamic range in the GLCM affect the texture features correlation, homogeneity, contrast and entropy in ADC images. The result shows that the GLCM size, image noise and the method for determining the dynamic range has a large impact on the texture features. Care should be taken when designing studies employing GLCM texture features to keep these parameters fixed, and to report imaging parameters and preprocessing steps clearly in publications.
